I've been an avid collector/archivist of Game Boy items since I was in my late 20's. I didn't have a Game Boy as a kid, but I had a Game Gear that I traded a kid at school a calculator for, which I had found. My fascination for handhelds never let up from that moment and I always found myself drawn to gaming on them instead of consoles. I had my fair share of consoles, but once I bought my own Nintendo GBA SP, I was hooked. I had each iteration of DS, 3DS, PSP, PS Vita, Switch, etc.

I started collecting Game Boy games as I tinkered with putting new displays in DMGs, Game Boy Colors, and Game Boy Pockets. One thing led to another and I started a spreadsheet, researched all the games for the North American collection and finally completed my North American collection (506 games!) in late 2022.

This blog is dedicated to the weird finds along the way, interesting tidbits I come across, and homebrew titles I play. I LOVE the Game Boy dev scene and all the fun games people are making.
